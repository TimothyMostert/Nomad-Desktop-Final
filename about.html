	<h1>My mission</h1>

	<p> My goal for this website is to provide a place where you can learn about the digital nomad lifestyle. What the movement involves, how to get started, tips, tricks, and issues to avoid and most importantly cultivating a healthy community.  </p>

	<p> Many people are waking up to the fact that in todays world, your work can be done from anywhere. Harnessing the power of the modern smartphone, laptop and ever increasing internet connectivity many skillsets are becoming totally location independant. This gives particpants an oppurtunity to focus on whats important in life, and the experiences that matter.</p>

	<p> I grew up in Cape Town South Africa, but I've always imagined myself a global citizen. After high school I decided to teach english in Japan for a year, ever since then I've been working towards being able to travel and work fulltime. These days I work as a freelance web developer, and travel as often as possible. I'm looking forward to share the tips I've learnt along the way, and providing a platform for others to do the same.</p>
